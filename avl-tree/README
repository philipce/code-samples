This project implements a self-balancing binary search tree, specifically
an AVL tree. In addition, a GUI is provided that allows the user to add or
remove words from a tree and visualize how the tree structure changes.

Detailed documentation on the AVL tree implementation is provided in the 
Javadoc (see doc/index.html).

The GUI is fairly straightforward--words are entered in the text field, 
and added/removed (depending on selection) when <Enter> is pressed. Note 
that duplicate values are not entered into the tree. 

The GUI can be launched by running the Main class as shown below.

    Example:
                avl-tree$ mkdir bin
                avl-tree$ javac src/pcepkg/avl/*.java -d ./bin
                avl-tree$ java -cp ./bin pcepkg.avl.Main
