This repository contains various projects that I think are suitable as code
samples--not too large, self contained, and not overly complex while still 
being (hopefully) interesting and non-trivial.

Some of the projects were inspired by college assignments, others by work 
projects, though many are just things I've hacked up for fun. It's worth 
noting that none of these sample projects belong to anyone else (e.g. no 
previous employer or classmate would be upset to find these online). My 
intent is that these samples give an idea of the kind of code that I enjoy
writing and some indication of my programming abilities.

Each project is contained in its own directory within this repository. 
Details on each project can be found in its respective README. Some
projects may require special hardware; where that is the case it will be 
noted in the documentatino. Below is a brief overview of the projects, 
organized by language (projects written in multiple languages are listed
under multiple headings).
