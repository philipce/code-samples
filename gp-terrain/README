This project uses Gaussian process methods to perform regression for 
the modeling of a point cloud. The dataset utilized is of elevation
readings taken by satellite. While the original dataset is quite dense,
the goal is to use relatively few sample points in creating a surface
that closely approximates the actual data. Both the full data set and
the model surface are shown, as well as the model uncertainty about its
prediction. Typically, the actual and predicted data match quite closely, 
though due to the non-determinism inherent in the method, some trials are
better than others. User defined parameters are set to good defaults, but
tweaking them can change the results significantly, for better or worse.

The project can be executed by running the main.m script in MATLAB.
