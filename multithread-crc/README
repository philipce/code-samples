This project is a multithreaded program that computes the checksum of each
file in a given directory. For each file in the directory, the file name 
and checksum are printed to the console, sorted alphabetically. 

The checksum function used is CRC32 (which is not my implementation--see 
crc.c for info). Error is printed for files that can't be read. The user 
must specify the directory name and the number of threads to spawn as 
command-line arguments. Directories inside the target directory are 
skipped. The user can specify between 1-99 worker threads.

A makefile is included with the project to build the executable 'run_crc'.

Example:

    $ make
    $ ./run_crc path/to/dir 5
