This project implements the basic Kalman filter and demonstrates its use
for projectile tracking. The included script generates a trajectory for a
small ball shot from a canon and shows how the Kalman filter, using a
simple, inaccurate model and noisy observations on the actual trajectory, 
produces a good estimate of the balls actual state. Results are given in
the form of a plot, showing: the ball's actual trajectory; the ball's
trajectory according to the simple transition model used by the filter; the 
believed state according to the filter; and the noisy and sporadic
measurements made on the actual trajectory.

The project can be executed by running the main.m script in MATLAB.

Though the script demonstrates the use of the kalman filter on a 2D
projectile example, the kalman_filter.m function itself is general enough 
to be used for other purposes. Additionally, user defined parameters in the
main.m script can be tweaked to exhibit different behavior in the 
projectile example.
