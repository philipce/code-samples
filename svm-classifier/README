This modules defines and uses a support vector machine to perform binary 
classification. Input data may be of arbitrary dimension. Output labels 
are either +1 or -1. This module also contains code to perform k-fold 
cross validation across multiple cores.

An example of the classifier can be run, by providing data dimension and 
paths to files containing test and training sets. A couple of data sets 
are included.

    Example:
    
        $ ./classifier.py 10 ./data0/train ./data0/test
