This modules defines and uses a support vector machine to perform binary classification. Input data 
may be of arbitrary dimension. Output labels are either +1 or -1. This module also contains code to 
perform k-fold cross validation across multiple cores.

An example of the classifier can be run, by providing data dimension and paths to files containing 
test and training sets. A fifth argument can be provided to add a constant bias to the input data.
See the function readFile for details on determining the data dimension and adding a bias.

    Example:
    
        $ ./classifier.py 11 ./data0/train ./data0/test
        
            OR
            
        $ ./classifier.py 5 ./astro/scaled/train ./astro/scaled/test 1
